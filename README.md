## 💡 My process

### 🔧 Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Internal CSS (no external files)

### 🎯 What I learned

I practiced creating a centered card layout using Flexbox and internal CSS, and understood how to structure reusable components and apply responsive design principles.

### 🔥 Continued development

Next, I plan to:
- Implement this layout using a CSS framework like Tailwind
- Add animations and transitions
- Convert this into a React component for practice
